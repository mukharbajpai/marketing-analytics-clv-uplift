## Key Analysis Performed
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Distribution of transaction amounts
   - Transactions per customer
   - Campaign response rates
   - Visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn

2. **Campaign Uplift Analysis**
   - Compared **treatment vs control** group conversions
   - Calculated **conversion rates, 95% confidence intervals**, and **p-values**
   - Found statistically significant uplift in the treatment group

3. **Insights**
   - The campaign treatment **significantly increased conversions** (p-value â‰ˆ 2.85e-8)
   - Visualized key metrics for quick interpretation
   - Can be extended to **compute incremental revenue** and **predictive modeling for CLV**
